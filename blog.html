                Recipe Of Paneer Tikka
            </h2>
            <p>
                Paneer Tikka is a popular and delicious tandoori snack where Paneer (Indian cottage cheese cubes) are marinated in a spiced yogurt-based marinade, arranged on skewers and grilled in the oven. Worry not if you don’t have an oven – instead of grilling in oven, you can make Paneer Tikka Recipe on stovetop on a tawa/skillet. In this post I am sharing both the oven and stovetop methods

                Recipe Of Corn Bhel!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Chaat for an Indian is not just a dish, but an emotion. Literally, a ‘chaat’ would mean ‘to lick‘ or ‘to taste‘. True, because you really can’t stop yourself from doing so once you indulge in this mélange of flavors. The same goes for this Corn Chaat too. It may be wholesome and simpler than the rest, but still is perfect. This vegan Corn Chaat recipe is a tangy amalgamation of steamed/boiled sweet corn tossed with crunchy onions, tangy tomatoes, flavorful chaat masala, fragrant herbs and earthy spices.

                Mix the butter and olive oil in a small bowl until combined well. Then add garlic before mixing in with pesto leaves from basil-- Thyme too if you want! When blending, top off each slice by pouring an Alfredo sauce mixture overtop, including tomatoes and feta cheese, so all is covered beautifully but not drowning out any flavor.
